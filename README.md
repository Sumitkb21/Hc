# Health Center, IITK

Welcome to the Health Center IIT Kanpur website repository!

## Project Overview

In this project, we have developed a comprehensive MERN Stack website tailored specifically for the Health Center IITK. Our website serves as a digital replacement for traditional patient health booklets, streamlining the entire process by eliminating the need for pen and paper.

## Key Features

### For Patients:
- **Digital Health Records:** Our website enables patients to securely access and download copies of their past health records, empowering them with convenient control over their medical history anytime, anywhere.
  
- **Appointment Management:** Appointment are created by the receptionist through the platform when a patient visit the health center.

### For Receptionists:
- **Appointment Coordination:** Receptionists can efficiently manage appointment scheduling, check-ins, and assist patients with inquiries through the platform.

### For Doctors:

- **Appointment Scheduling:** Doctors can view all appointments scheduled for them by the receptionist which are not taken by them yet.

- **Prescriptions:** Doctors can prescribe medications and treatments directly within the website's interface. Prescriptions are linked to the corresponding appointment and can be accessed by both medical staff and patients for further processing and collection of prescribed medicines.

### For IITK Pharmacy:

- **Access to Appointments:** Pharmacy staff can access all appointments scheduled by doctors. They are granted write access to mark the availability of medicines prescribed by doctors. If a prescribed medicine is not available in the inventory, pharmacy staff can refer the prescription to Apollo Pharmacy for further assistance.

- **Management of Past Prescription Records:** Pharmacy staff can upload, store copies of patients' past prescriptions and download for reference purposes.
